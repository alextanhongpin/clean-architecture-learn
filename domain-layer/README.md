# Domain Layer

This directory contains ADR (Architecture Decision Records) on writing better domain layer in Golang. The implementation of domain layer in other language may differ due to language features, and hence the examples here may not be idiomatic in other languages.


Creational
- factory, builder and constructor
- avoiding mega constructor

Behavioral
- getter, setter and wither
- dealing with enums, value object
- enums as data from database
- constraints in database vs in memory
- separate types (date, set, stringcase, range)
- dealing with null types vs pointers
- error handling
- polymorphism
- computed value
- statuses and state machine
- concurrency

Tactical
- usecase and user story
- entity vs model representation
