# Collection

- Collection is different than aggregate
- Collection is just a list of entities
- Some constraints may apply to collection, e.g. unique within collection, can have up to k items per collection
- A `set` is an example of collection where there can only be one unique entity with the collection
- A `hash map` is another collection where entities are represented by the (unique) key
- Collection may implement sorting, filtering, find or map methods too.
- Custom methods like checking len, isUnique
