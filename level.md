breaking code at levels.

Software is about tradeoffs. we were code in different ways to manage different scenarios. Most software begins at level 0.

Level 0
- the most basic implementation
- zero abstraction

Level 1
- abstraction to fulfil case 1

Level 2
- abstraction to fulfil case 2

The level does not imply any order.
