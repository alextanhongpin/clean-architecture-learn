# Architectural Patterns

This directory contains advanced architectural patterns and practices for building scalable, maintainable applications.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### [architecture/](architecture/)
Core architectural patterns:
- **Feature-Oriented Architecture**: Organizing code around business capabilities
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async communication patterns

### [validation/](validation/)
Validation patterns and strategies:
- **Domain Validation**: Business rule validation within entities
- **Application Validation**: Input validation and authorization
- **Cross-Cutting Validation**: Validation that spans multiple contexts

### [error-handling/](error-handling/)
Error handling and resilience patterns:
- **Error Propagation**: How errors flow through layers
- **Domain Errors**: Business-specific error handling
- **Retry and Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns

### [persistence/](persistence/)
Data access and persistence patterns:
- **Repository Patterns**: Advanced repository implementations
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction management patterns
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

## 🎯 Pattern Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern

#### Feature-Oriented Architecture
- ✅ Team ownership by business capability
- ✅ Microservices preparation
- ✅ Reducing coupling between features
- ❌ Small applications with few features

#### Domain-Driven Design
- ✅ Complex business logic
- ✅ Large development teams
- ✅ Long-term projects
- ❌ Simple CRUD applications

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- ✅ Loosely coupled systems
- ✅ Scalability requirements
- ✅ Audit and analytics needs
- ❌ Simple request-response workflows

## 🔧 Implementation Approach

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic patterns
2. **Add Complexity**: Introduce patterns as problems arise
3. **Measure Impact**: Validate that patterns solve real problems
4. **Refactor Safely**: Use tests to enable safe refactoring

### Pattern Combination
- Patterns can be combined effectively
- Some patterns are complementary (Repository + Unit of Work)
- Others are alternatives (Layered vs Feature-Oriented)
- Choose based on your specific context and constraints

## 📚 Learning Resources

- **Books**: Listed in each pattern directory
- **Examples**: See `../implementation/` for code samples
- **Case Studies**: Real-world applications in `../examples/`

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new patterns:
1. Include clear problem statement
2. Provide implementation examples
3. Document trade-offs and alternatives
4. Add references to authoritative sources

**Remember**: Patterns are tools, not destinations. Use them to solve specific problems, not for their own sake.
