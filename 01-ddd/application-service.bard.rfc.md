## Request for Comments: Application Service in Domain-Driven Design

### Abstract

This document provides an overview of the Application Service layer in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), outlining its responsibilities, design principles, and common usage patterns. It also addresses key distinctions between Application Services and Domain Services.

### Status of This Memo

This memo is an informational document published for review and discussion. It does not represent an Internet Standard.

### Introduction

The Application Service layer plays a crucial role in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) by serving as the bridge between the domain model and the outer layers of the application. It encapsulates the orchestration of use cases, manages interactions with external components, and enforces business logic constraints.

### Responsibilities of Application Services

Application Services are primarily responsible for:

1. **Orchestrating Use Cases:** Application Services handle the execution of use cases, coordinating the interactions between domain entities, domain services, and repositories. They encapsulate the workflow and logic required to fulfill specific user requests.

2. **Adapter Integration:** Application Services serve as an integration point for external adapters, such as messaging systems, logging services, and authentication modules. They abstract away the complexities of these external components, allowing the domain layer to focus on business logic.

3. **Transaction Management:** Application Services manage transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity when multiple entities need to be updated within a single operation. They coordinate the execution of unit of work patterns.

### Distinguishing Application Services from Domain Services

While both Application Services and Domain Services play essential roles in DDD, they differ in their scope and responsibilities:

- **Application Service:** Responsible for orchestrating use cases, handling external interactions, and managing transactions. It does not contain business logic.

- **Domain Service:** Encapsulates complex business logic that cannot be directly attributed to domain entities. It resides within the domain layer and enforces business rules.

### Common Application Service Flow

A typical Application Service operation follows this pattern:

1. **Fetch Entities:** Retrieve the necessary domain entities from repositories.

2. **Execute Domain Logic:** Invoke domain services to perform business logic operations on the retrieved entities.

3. **Persist Changes:** Persist any modifications made to the entities through repositories.

### Application Service Design Principles

- **Anemic Domain Model:** Avoid exposing domain entities directly to the Application Service. Instead, use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or other custom data structures to represent domain data.

- **Dependency Resolution:** Utilize a dependency injection mechanism to manage the dependencies of Application Service components, ensuring loose coupling and testability.

- **Error Handling:** Handle and propagate domain-specific errors consistently, providing meaningful error messages to the caller.

### Validation Strategies

- **Input Validation:** Input validation should be performed in the presentation layer or a dedicated validation layer, not in the Application Service.

- **Domain Validation:** Application Services should rely on domain services to validate business rules and domain constraints.

- **Exception Handling:** Application Services should throw exceptions for invalid inputs or domain rule violations, allowing for centralized error handling.

### Testing Considerations

- **Unit Testing:** Application Services should be unit-testable, with mocks or stubs for external dependencies.

- **Integration Testing:** Integration testing should verify the interaction between Application Services and other components, such as repositories and domain services.

### Conclusion

The Application Service layer serves as a critical component in DDD, bridging the gap between the domain layer and the external world. By adhering to its responsibilities and design principles, Application Services can effectively orchestrate use cases, manage transactions, and ensure the integrity of the domain model.
