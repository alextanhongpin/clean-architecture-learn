Using interface as a contract

- specifying concrete types means modifying input structs when a new field is added
- On the other hand, changing interface just requires changing the internal implementation (granted that all those fields are provided)

Eg. Type User has 10 fields

There are two ways to update

Domain update
1. fetch the existing entity first
2. Make changes
3. Save changes

Change set
1. Validate changes
2. Save changes
3. Handle errors

Change set makes sense for
- bulk
- Non business logic fields, like remarks

Ddd, vs crud
Data vs behaviour
Ddd however depends on data validation too.
Data for ddd should be valid.
Modifying data vs applying behaviour (are value objects part of ddd)
Validation for aggregates vs single entity.
Validation before and after
Batch validation, precise row with error. 
Using interfaces to represent entity.
What is an entity? Something that has lifecycle?

# Repository
- business logic in db
- mapping errors to domain
- passive errors, errors returned after insert or update
- active errors, errors returned before insert
- bulk errors
- errors from triggers, constraint, integrity
- if the data can be validated in bulk before insert, then aggregate them before i sertion
- else, insert them line by line in a single transaction to get the specific error message

How to represent an entity?
- struct with public fields
- Struct with private fields, and getters
- Interfaces
-   Immutability
-   Good for whitelist
- Use valid method to check if itâ€™s instantiated, or use a custom vet to check unwanted initialisation, or add panic on method call on initialised fn. run the vet before app run instead of after test.

Service/usecase/domain
- returning, error or bool/nil?

Updating in repository
- find and update pattern, returning the new submission will save all the data, returning nil will skip
- Wrapping in tx 
- Tx with event context for publishing outbox messages
